Description: PowerMap, a MatLab software tool for neuro-imaging study planning, is one of very few software tools that can facilitate massive multiple comparison of voxels and determine power and sample size from brain MRI data. [3] “PowerMap implements theoretical power calculation algorithms based on non-central random field theory. It can also calculate power for statistical analyses with FDR (false discovery rate) corrections.” [3] However, PowerMap has limited compatibility and accessibility, as it requires the purchase of a MatLab license for usage. The purpose of this project has been to offer the functionalities of PowerMap in an open source Python software for accessibility to a broader range of users.
