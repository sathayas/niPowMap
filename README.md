# niPowMap
## Power map for neuroimaging studies

This is a Python version of PowerMap, a software tool for calculating statistical power and sample sizes for neuroimaging studies. The original PowerMap project produced an eponymous software tool based on MATLAB. The goal of this project is to port PowerMap on a Python-based platform, so that the tool can be run without MATLAB.

This is still an ongoing project, and codes are being translated into Python.
